# Humankind: The Problem-Solving Species

Let’s face it: humans are obsessed with solving problems. It’s basically our thing. From figuring out how to grow crops 10,000 years ago to building apps that remind us to drink water (seriously, we’re that bad at staying hydrated), our history is one big problem-solving journey. But have you ever stopped to think about how we do it? Like, what’s the actual process that makes us so good at coming up with solutions?

If you’ve never thought about it, no worries—I’m here to ramble about it for the next ten minutes.

## Why Are We So Good at This?

It all boils down to how we approach problems. Humans have this incredible ability to balance instinct with logic, creativity with structure, and brute-force trial and error with elegant frameworks. Essentially, we rely on knowledge, but knowledge alone isn’t enough. It’s what we do with that knowledge that makes us unique.

Now, the way we apply knowledge to solve problems can be broken into a few key elements, which I’m going to dive into. Don’t worry—it’s not as boring as it sounds (or at least I hope not). Think of this as a casual stroll through the mechanics of human genius.

## First Principles Thinking: The Big Reset Button

You’ve probably heard the phrase “first principles” thrown around a lot lately. It’s kind of trendy, especially in tech and engineering circles. But what does it really mean?

In plain English, first principles thinking is about breaking things down to their most basic, fundamental truths. It’s like stripping away all the noise, assumptions, and “this is how we’ve always done it” nonsense to get to the core of the problem.

Let’s say you want to lose weight. A non-first-principles thinker might just say, “I need to eat less and exercise more,” because that’s what everyone says, right? But a first-principles thinker would ask: “Why do humans gain weight? What’s actually happening in the body? How do calories, hormones, and metabolism interact?”

By asking those deeper questions, you get to the root cause. And when you solve problems from the root, you often find solutions no one else has thought of yet. That’s why first principles thinking is behind so many breakthroughs—like the electric car or reusable rockets. (Yes, I’m looking at you, Elon Musk.)

## Experience: The Stuff We Know Without Thinking About It

But here’s the thing: most of us don’t have time to break down every single problem into first principles. If we did, we’d never get anything done. That’s where experience comes in. Experience is like your brain’s built-in shortcut system. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you rely on what’s worked before.

For example, if you’ve been driving for years, you don’t need to analyze the physics of braking every time you stop at a red light. Your brain just knows what to do. This kind of intuitive problem-solving is what makes experience so valuable—it’s fast, efficient, and often pretty accurate.

But here’s the catch: experience can also trap us. When we rely too much on what’s worked in the past, we can miss out on new, better solutions. That’s why combining experience with first principles thinking is so powerful—it gives you the best of both worlds.

## The Role of Ontology (AKA Organizing Our Messy Knowledge)

Okay, this might sound fancy, but bear with me. Ontology is just a big word for organizing stuff. Specifically, it’s about organizing knowledge into categories and hierarchies so we can make sense of it. If first principles thinking is about breaking things down, ontology is about putting them back together in a way that makes sense.

Let me give you an example. Imagine you’re trying to build a recipe app. You could just throw a bunch of random recipes into a database and call it a day, but that would be chaos. Instead, you’d organize them into categories: breakfast, lunch, dinner, vegetarian, gluten-free, 30-minute meals, etc. That’s ontology in action—it’s creating a structure that makes the information usable.

In problem-solving, ontology helps us map out complex systems so we can see how all the pieces fit together. It’s especially important in fields like medicine, engineering, and AI, where there’s just way too much information to handle without some kind of structure.

## Model-Based vs. Memory-Based Reasoning: Two Ways to Think

Now, let’s talk about the two main ways humans reason through problems: model-based reasoning and memory-based reasoning. Don’t worry—this isn’t as abstract as it sounds.
	•	Model-Based Reasoning is when you create a mental (or literal) model of how something works and use that to predict outcomes. It’s great for solving new, unfamiliar problems. For example, if you’re designing a bridge, you’d use models of physics and engineering to figure out the best design.
	•	Memory-Based Reasoning, on the other hand, is when you rely on past experiences or pre-existing knowledge. It’s faster but less flexible. For example, if your toaster breaks, you might just fix it the same way you fixed your last toaster.

Here’s the key: both types of reasoning are important, but they’re suited to different situations. Model-based reasoning is like a slow, methodical chef who measures every ingredient. Memory-based reasoning is like a home cook who eyeballs everything because they’ve made the recipe a hundred times.

## Why This Matters (And Why You Should Care)

You might be thinking, “Okay, cool, but why does any of this matter?” Well, it matters because the way we solve problems determines pretty much everything about our lives. Whether you’re trying to fix a broken sink, launch a startup, or tackle a global crisis, understanding how you approach problems can make you way more effective.

Here’s a fun exercise: next time you’re stuck on a problem, ask yourself which tools you’re using. Are you leaning on experience? Breaking things down to first principles? Building a mental model? You might be surprised by how much clarity this brings.

## A Final Ramble: The Future of Problem-Solving

As we move into the future, our problems are only going to get more complex. Climate change, AI ethics, space exploration—these aren’t things we can solve with gut instincts or “business as usual” thinking. We’re going to need all the tools in our problem-solving toolkit: first principles, experience, ontology, and both types of reasoning.

And here’s the good news: we’ve been doing this for thousands of years. It’s in our DNA. As long as we keep learning, experimenting, and thinking critically, there’s no problem we can’t tackle.

So, the next time someone says, “Humans are so bad at solving problems,” you can say, “Actually, we’re amazing at it. It’s literally what we’re built for.”

Now let's go solve something. The world is waiting.
